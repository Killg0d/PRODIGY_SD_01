# PRODIGY_SD_01
Task is to create a temperature conversion program which will converts temperatures between celcius, fareheit and kelvin scales.
The program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

# Temperature Converter

This is a simple temperature converter application built with React. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Features

- Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Real-time updates as you type in any of the temperature fields.
- Responsive and clean UI design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/temperature-converter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd temperature-converter
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Code Overview

- `src/components/TemperatureConverter.js`: This file contains the main logic for the temperature converter.
- `src/styles/Temperature.css`: This file contains the styles for the temperature converter.
- `src/App.js`: This is the main component that renders the `TemperatureConverter` component.
- `src/index.js`: This is the entry point of the React application.

### Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Enter a value in any of the temperature fields (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
3. The other fields will automatically update to reflect the converted values.
